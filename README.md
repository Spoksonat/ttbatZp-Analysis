Top Reconstruction Analysis Code
===============
In this github page you can find the files used by the Uniandes Pheno Group for the analysis of t tbar Zprime signals and its corresponding Standard Model backgrounds using MadAnalysis. 
There are two levels for the analysis:

1. Analysis at Madgraph level (Files in Madanalysis_level folder).
2. Analysis at Delphes level (Files in Delphes_level folder).

In each folder, you will find the .h and .cpp files (mandatory for run MadAnalysis) as well as a bash script (execute_all.sh). The bash script allows to run Madnalysis over the signals and backgrounds specified in the .sh file.
